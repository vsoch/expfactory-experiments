Hi Vanessa,

So in this file I have the script for the digit span experiment, the single-stim plugin, the jspsych file, style.css file, and the images for the experiment. 

What I am trying to accomplish for this experiment is with each trial, I may need to change the number of stimuli that is presented in the next trial.  Essentially, 
subjects will be presented with a series of digits (5 is the starting point) and the subject must repeat the digits presented.  There is a performance accuracy after 
the subject responds, and if they respond correctly on two consecutive trials of the same digit length, digit length goes up by 1.  The length of this array is what I am trying to change.  
I believe this parameter to be coded either in the plug-in file or in the jspsych file, but with my limited js programming, has taken me quite some time to locate and change what I need to change.

Any help in direction would be greatly appreciated, and moreover, I just generally appreciate your help.

Thanks Vanessa!
